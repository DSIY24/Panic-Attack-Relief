    <h2>Persistent Symptoms</h2>
    <p>Most panic attacks last between <span>5 and 20 minutes</span>. Some have been reported to last up to an hour.So if you have been feeling your symptoms for longer then there may be reason for concern</p>
    <br>

        <p>Both panic and heart attacks cause chest discomfort, but there is a difference. “With a heart attack, pain radiates to other areas like the arm, jaw or neck,” Dr. Miller says. “If it's a panic attack,” she notes, “pain will typically stay in the chest.”</p>

     </div>
     <br>
    <P>As Dr Miller mentioned above, if the pain / discomfort does spread to other areas of the body and other unrelated symptoms arise it would be valid to seek medical intervention as soon as possible</P>
    <br>
    <p>On the other hand if you are sure that you are undergoing a panic attack and want to relive the symptoms,Benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (Xanax), can help treat the symptoms of panic when they occur.
        However,<span> they won't help treat an underlying anxiety disorder and can quickly lead to dependence.</span>For this reason, doctors only recommend them for short-term use during a crisis.</p>

   <div id="Preparation">
    <h2>How To Prepare</h2>
    <p>Going for counseling can often help people who have panic attacks and who have panic disorders. CBT (Cognative-behaviour therapy) aims to help you change the way you see challenging or frightening situations and to help you find new ways to approach these challenges as they arise.
        You can find CBT for individuals or groups, online or face-to-face, and the length of treatment can also vary. In exposure-based CBT, your therapist will expose you to something that can trigger a panic attack and help you work your way through it.
        As well as changing behavior, there is some evidence that CBT might affect structures in your brain that are responsible for panic symptoms.</p>
    <br>
        <p>Another effective method in diagnosing Panic Attacks is through the use of Heart Beat Sensors and Electrocardiographs</p>
